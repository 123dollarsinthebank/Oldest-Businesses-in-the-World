# Oldest-Businesses-in-the-World
It’s fascinating to imagine how across the globe, different tribes / communities / kingdoms conduct business and fair trade (less likely) in order to provide for their customers and families. Businesses as observed in this study have not only been around for thousands of years but some of them are operating today! 

In order to capture and present these findings, I needed to merge several different files together to gather the appropriate data from across the site, including businesses, categories and countries data. This allowed me to understand the oldest businesses in the world (very high level) to the oldest businesses by continent, country and in each business category. It was also peculiar to capture those countries missing from the list as data hasn’t been provided or these countries are still rather indegenious. 

Review the file to learn more!
